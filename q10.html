        A database is a separate application that stores a collection of data. Each database has one or more distinct APIs for creating, accessing, managing, searching and replicating the data it holds.</span>Other kinds of data stores can also be used, such as files on the file system or large hash tables in memory but data fetching and writing would not be so fast and easy with those type of systems.

        Nowadays, we use relational database management systems (RDBMS) to store and manage huge volume of data. This is called relational database because all the data is stored into different tables and relations are established using primary keys or other keys known as Foreign Keys.</p>
      
      <p><span style = "color:blue;">
        MySQL is a fast, easy-to-use RDBMS being used for many small and big businesses. MySQL is developed, marketed and supported by MySQL AB, which is a Swedish company. MySQL is becoming so popular because of many good reasons.</span></p>
        <p>MySQL is released under an open-source license. So you have nothing to pay to use it.

            MySQL is a very powerful program in its own right. It handles a large subset of the functionality of the most expensive and powerful database packages.
            
            MySQL uses a standard form of the well-known SQL data language.
            
            MySQL works on many operating systems and with many languages including PHP, PERL, C, C++, JAVA, etc.
            
            MySQL works very quickly and works well even with large data sets.
            
            MySQL is very friendly to PHP, the most appreciated language for web development.</p>
        <p>MySQL supports large databases, up to 50 million rows or more in a table. The default file size limit for a table is 4GB, but you can increase this (if your operating system can handle it) to a theoretical limit of 8 million terabytes (TB).</p>
        <p><span style = "color:blue;">MySQL is customizable. The open-source GPL license allows programmers to modify the MySQL software to fit their own specific environments.</span></p>
